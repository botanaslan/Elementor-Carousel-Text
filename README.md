# Elementor Carousel Text
In this article we will learn how to create a simple text carousel using CSS only. We will integrate the CSS with Elementor heading elements, to create our Elementor text slider.

Note that all the CSS snippets provided below were first passed through the autoprefixer, for greater browser compatibility.

# Extra: to pause the carousel on hover

In the video, I mentioned this would not be possible without JavaScript... Well just after completing the recording, I realised in fact it was quite simple to pause it with some CSS. Here it is! Just add this CSS, and it will pause the carousel on hover.

Important: add the class 'carouselparent' to the parent section, for this to work!
